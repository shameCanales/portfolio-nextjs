        Learned and started using git and GitHub as my version control system
        for the projects that i am building and it is really a game changer for
        every developer like me. Iâ€™m consistently updating my repositories as
        you can see in my contribution calendar and
        <a
          href="https://github.com/shameCanales"
          className="underline underline-offset-4"
          target="_blank"
