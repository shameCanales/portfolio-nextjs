          I&apos;m a fresh IT graduate and self-taught developer passionate about
          turning ideas into interactive, user-friendly web experiences. With
          certifications in React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and UI/UX design, I&apos;ve
          built a strong foundation for creating clean, component-driven
          interfaces that perform beautifully across devices. Currently, I&apos;m
          focused on mastering frontend development with React, Next.js,
          Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit, and TanStack Query, while also exploring
          backend technologies to become a well-rounded developer.

          I thrive at the intersection of design and developmentâ€”crafting sleek,
          minimalist UIs that balance creativity and functionality. From leading
          the development of a Web-Based Water Billing Management System as a
          capstone project to building hands-on personal projects, I enjoy
          solving real-world problems, writing clean reusable code, and
          continuously sharpening my skills. Driven by curiosity and
          consistency, I aim to contribute, grow, and create meaningful digital
          solutions one project at a time.
