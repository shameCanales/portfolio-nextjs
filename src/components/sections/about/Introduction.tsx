            I&apos;m a fresh IT graduate and self-taught developer passionate
            about turning ideas into interactive, user-friendly web experiences.
            With certifications in React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and UI/UX
            design, I&apos;ve built a strong foundation for creating clean,
            component-driven interfaces that perform beautifully across devices.
            Currently, I&apos;m focused on mastering frontend development with
            React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit, and TanStack Query,
            while also exploring backend technologies to become a well-rounded
            developer.

            I thrive at the intersection of design and developmentâ€”crafting
            sleek, minimalist UIs that balance creativity and functionality.
            From leading the development of a Web-Based Water Billing Management
            System as a capstone project to building hands-on personal projects,
            I enjoy solving real-world problems, writing clean reusable code,
            and continuously sharpening my skills. Driven by curiosity and
            consistency, I aim to contribute, grow, and create meaningful
            digital solutions one project at a time.
